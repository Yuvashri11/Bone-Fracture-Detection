## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated bone fracture detection system using deep learning techniques. It leverages medical imaging, such as X-rays, to accurately identify fractures in bones, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating injuries more efficiently.

## Features
- **Automated Detection**: The model identifies fractures in bone X-rays, reducing the need for manual inspection.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and fracture classification.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhances diagnostic accuracy, reducing human error in detecting fractures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles medical image preprocessing steps, such as normalization and augmentation, to improve model generalization.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: X-ray images of fractured and non-fractured bones are collected and labeled.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images undergo resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**: A CNN-based deep learning model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn fracture detection.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
5. **Deployment**: The trained model can be integrated into healthcare systems or applications for real-time fracture detection.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test set and demonstrates a strong ability to detect fractures across various bone types.

## Future Work
- Improve model performance with larger datasets.
- Extend the system to detect other types of injuries or abnormalities.
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time fracture detection.
